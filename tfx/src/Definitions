The Traveller Map - Second Survey Data Definitions

The Traveller5 Second Survey format defines a standard for describing star
systems in the Official Traveller Universe. It is composed of a series of
fields describing various aspects of the Main World (MW) in each system
including physical and cultural characteristics, and some details about
other bodies in the system of interest to travellers.

The data for Regina (Spinward Marches 1910), home of Duke Norris and an
influential world on the edge of the Third Imperium can be summarized in
Second Survey format as:
1910 Regina A788899-C Ri Pa Ph An Cp (Amindii)2 { 4 } (D7E+4) [9C6D] BcCeF NS - 703 8 ImDd F7 V BD M3 V

Different editions of Traveller and different authors and publications may include different fields, present the fields in different orders, or provide different values for fields. The companion document Sector Data File Formats may be used for reference.

The hexagon location of the world within a sector, given as a four digit number.
The first two digits are the distance from the spinward edge in parsecs ranging
from 01 through 32. The second two digits are the distance from the coreward
edge in parsecs ranging from 01 through 40.

Base codes show the presence of military bases in a system; special codes deal with the presence of more than one type of base within the same system in order to maintain a single base code letter per system.

If no bases are present in the system, the field may be empty, a blank (space) or - (dash).

Base codes have changed significantly between different editions of Traveller. Sector data collections must indicate which set of codes are in use. Sector data collections may also define custom meanings for base codes.

PBG - Population, Belts, Giants
1910 Regina A788899-C Ri Pa Ph An Cp (Amindii)2 { 4 } (D7E+4) [9C6D] BcCeF NS - 703 8 ImDd F7 V BD M3 V

Population Multiplier
1910 Regina A788899-C Ri Pa Ph An Cp (Amindii)2 { 4 } (D7E+4) [9C6D] BcCeF NS - 703 8 ImDd F7 V BD M3 V

The first eHex digit is the population multiplier. Together with the population
exponent in the UWP field, the world population can be computed as:

population = multiplier × 10exponent

Some legacy files may erroneously have 0 for the population multiplier but
non-zero for the population exponent. Treat the multiplier as 1 in these cases.
Planetoid Belts
1910 Regina A788899-C Ri Pa Ph An Cp (Amindii)2 { 4 } (D7E+4) [9C6D] BcCeF NS - 703 8 ImDd F7 V BD M3 V

The second eHex digit is the number of planetoid belts in the system. A main
world of size 0 is termed an asteriod belt, and is not counted here.
Gas Giants
1910 Regina A788899-C Ri Pa Ph An Cp (Amindii)2 { 4 } (D7E+4) [9C6D] BcCeF NS - 703 8 ImDd F7 V BD M3 V

The third eHex digit is the number of gas giants in the system, suitable for
fuel skimming.


Worlds
1910 Regina A788899-C Ri Pa Ph An Cp (Amindii)2 { 4 } (D7E+4) [9C6D] BcCeF NS - 703 8 ImDd F7 V BD M3 V

The number of "worlds" in the system. This is given as a decimal integer, and
will always be at least 1 (the main world) plus the number of planetoid belts
(see PBG) plus the number of gas giants (see PBG) but will include other planets
orbiting the star(s) in the system.

1910 Regina A788899-C Ri Pa Ph An Cp (Amindii)2 { 4 } (D7E+4) [9C6D] BcCeF NS - 703 8 ImDd F7 V BD M3 V

Allegiances indicate the government which dominates a system. A short abbreviation is used.

Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, Traveller: The New Era, Traveller: 4th Edition


Older versions of Traveller use a 2-character code. Due to the limited number
of useful 2-character codes, these are not unique across Charted Space.

Code 	Description
As 	Aslan (general designation).
A0 	Aslan Tlauku Clan (numbers 0-9 indicate Tlauku clan).
Cs 	Client State (usually of the Imperium).
Dr 	Droyne.
Hv 	Hive Federation.
Im 	Imperium.
Kk 	The Two Thousand Worlds (K’kree).
Na 	Non-Aligned (independent neutral world without affiliation).
So 	Solomani Confederation.
Va 	Vargr (general designation).
Vx 	Vargr (2nd digit 0-9 or letter a-z indicates specific allegiance)
Zh 	Zhodani Consulate.
-- 	Empty, unclaimed system.
Stellar Data

Stellar Data indicates the spectral and luminosity class of each star in the
system. This uses a subset of the Morgan–Keenan classification system (also
known as Yerkes or MKK), such as G2 V where G2 is the color/temperature
(2⁄10th of the way from yellow G to orange K on the spectrum) and V is the
luminosity/size (main sequence).

The size code D may be used for white dwarf stars, either alone or followed by
a spectral code, e.g. DB, DA, DF, DG, DK, DM. (Note: This differs significantly
from real-world classification of white dwarf stars.)

The special code BD may be used for brown dwarf, sub-stellar objects.
Stellar Spectral Class
Code 	Description 	Temperature (K)
O 	Blue 	>33,000
B 	Blue-White 	10,000-33,000
A 	Blue-White 	7,500-10,000
F 	Yellow-White 	6,000-7,500
G 	Yellow 	5,200-6,000
K 	Orange 	3,700-5,200
M 	Red 	2,000-3,700

Stellar type indicates the spectral classification of a star; colors are the
essential perceived colors of the star’s visible light.


Stellar Luminosity

The luminosity gives the magnitude, or brightness of the star. This correlates
with the size of the star, although it varies depending on spectral class.

Code 	Description 	Diameter (Sol = 1)
Ia 	Bright Supergiant. 	52 - 3500
Ib 	Weak Supergiant. 	30 - 3000
II 	Bright Giant. 	14 - 1000
III 	Normal Giant. 	4.6 - 360
IV 	Subgiant. 	3.3 - 13
V 	Main Sequence Star. 	0.2 - 10
VI 	Subdwarf. 	0.1 - 1.2
D 	White Dwarf. 	0.006 - 0.018
eHex - Extended Hexadecimal


Traveller encodes numbers using "extended hexadecimal", which is really a way
of encoding numbers larger than 9 into a single printable character.
Numbers in the range 0-9 are represented as 0-9 as normal. Like hexadecimal,
values in the range 10-15 are represented as A-F (always uppercase). But the
encoding continues for values in the range 16-17 as G-H, 18-22 as J-N,
and 23-30 as P-W.

Codes X, Y and Z may be used for 31-33 or may be reserved for exceptional
values. Code X, in particular, is reserved for unknown values, such as the
details of intentionally unexplored systems. Codes I and O are unused to avoid
confusion with 1 and 0.
